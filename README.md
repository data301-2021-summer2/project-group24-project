## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{This dataset was found on the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/simranjain17/insurance), and is the data about basic health insurance premium of individuals in the US based on different variables. It contains information about the age, the gender, the Body Mass Index of the policy holder, the number of children covered by the insurance, whether the policy holder is a smoker or non-smoker, the region where the policy holder belongs to, as well as the insurance premium charged to the policy holder. Each row states the above details of each one of the policy holders. Unfortunately, I was not able to find when and how this data was collected, and without this information, this dataset might not provide timely information for me to make any prediction. However, it is still possible for me to analyze how the insurance premium is related to each of the variables, which is the main purpose why I selected this dataset for my project. I may also be able to dig into some geographical information from this dataset. Some other limitation might be this is a biased sample, as it didnâ€™t state how the data was collected. }

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{This dataset has provided information about the insurance premium based on different variables: age, gender, BMI, number of dependents, whether a smoker or not, and region. I hope to find the relationship between the premium with each of these variables, and hopefully, it is possible to estimate the premium given a set of variables. I understand that the insurance premium must be related to the age, gender, health condition, number of depends, or whether the insured is a smoker or not; however, it might be interesting to find how exactly they are related to each other, and to know if the premium might be also affected by the region where the insured are living. With this dataset, I might also be able to get some insights about some demographic information, e.g., age distribution, sex distribution, the health condition (BMI) in different ages, genders, regions...I believe there should be quite some information that I could present in a Dashboard.}
